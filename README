This is a program to slurp packets out of one radio and chuck them out another.

To use this you need to enable MQTT uplink on the source radios. It requires
encryption to be disabled and proxy to client enabled.

The destination radios need to have a patched firmware to allow forging the
from field on packets.

So this will link a bluetooth radio to one over TCP.  `python pipe.py --bt adev_0060 --tcp 192.168.10.145`
